I switched careers as a programmer in 2019. There are many articles recommended 
to write your own blog. I find it troublesome, so I didn't do it. But I thought 
that is very important for my career recently and I have to do it right now. The
best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now. One
 of the important reason is my interview very awful recently. And I forget too m
uch details about what I had done. It's really embarrassing and frustrating.

So I start my blog right now. Even it's hard to find a good job now. I think thi
s is not only an important thing for my career, but also important for my life.
